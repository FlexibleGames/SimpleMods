# Rock Blocks
A mod for Vintage Story https://mods.vintagestory.at/rockblocks

## Simple
A very simple mod that allows you to recraft full blocks of rock with 4 stones. If you feel this is too cheaty there is a quarry mod that makes it a MUCH more involved process. 

## Issues
There is one reported recipe conflict with another mod, suggestions on a fix?

## Code
This mod is super simple and hasn't required an update for a long time. I do test all my mods on every new major version of the game. Suggestions or pull requests will be considered.
