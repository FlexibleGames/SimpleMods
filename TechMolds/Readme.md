# Tech Molds
A mod for Vintage Story https://mods.vintagestory.at/techmolds

## More Molds
A mod specifically to help players get into the mod QPTEch faster. Rods and screws can be a nightmare to craft on the anvil and the heating coil is equally frustrating.

Screw mold, Rod mold, and heating coil mold aim to quicken the pace you progress in QPTech. The resource cost is very close to manually crafting. You save mostly time and wear-and-tear on your wrists.

## Code
Files are for other players to reference to learn, please don't steal them for your own mod. Other mold suggestions for other possible mods are welcome, please use the issue tracker or pull requests.
