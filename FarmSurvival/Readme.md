# Farm Survival
A mod for Vintage Story

# v1.4
Added a patch for standard nutrient cost of all crop types. Delete "farmnutrients.json" patch file to cancel.

## Purpose
Attempts to make fruit trees grow faster at a higher success rate. I've played my worlds for many years and I have yet to harvest fruit from a tree. Frustrating.

Also tweaks crop survivablility to be more forgiving of temp ranges. You can't grow anything in winter, obviously. Wanted to grow a wider variety of crops at my home which isn't ideal for ALL crops obviously.

## Suggestions?
If you have experience with fruit trees I would greatly appreciate guidance. I just want it to grow and produce fruit within 2-3 years of planting. Please post a pull request or hit me up on discord.
