# Quartz Blocks
A mod for Vintage Story https://mods.vintagestory.at/quartzblocks

## Simple
A very simple mod that adds recipe for 'ancient' decor building blocks that are normally uncraftable. I like building, I like options on blocks... voila.

## Code
Simple mod, hasn't needed updating in several main VS version as it's just recipes. But if the time comes I need to change or augment this mod the code is safe. Feel free to offer suggestions or pull requests.
